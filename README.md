# Social Media Analysis
**Social media analytics** is the process of gathering and analyzing data from social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. It is commonly used by marketers to track online conversations about products and companies.


## Background 
  Fundamentally, “computer science is a science of abstraction.” Computer scientists must create abstractions of real-world problems that can be represented and manipulated in a computer.

Graph Theory is a relatively new area of mathematics, first studied by the super famous mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1735. Since then it has blossomed into a powerful tool used in nearly every branch of science and is currently an active area of mathematics research. A graph is a set of points (we call them vertices or nodes) connected by lines (edges or arcs).
